## About Me

Triggered by the lack of proper data analysis tools at work, I got interested in using <b>Jupyter Lab / Jupyter Notebooks</b> 
to extract relvant insights from data in a number of different contexts. 
When I took the first steps in this journey starting in December 2020, I had absolutely no idea about [Python](https://realpython.com/) nicknamed <em>'the Swiss Army Knive of programming languages'</em>.

>Despite having no formal background in software development,<br> I learned to effectively use [Pandas DataFrames](https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf) within [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/retro/notebooks/?path=notebooks/Intro.ipynb) as a tool to <em>get data evaluated and visualized</em> within a fraction of the time it took me in the past with the 'help' of traditional commercial software.

While exploring the possibilities of the [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) ecosystem, I have built a number of samller and larger projects that help 

  - my team keep ahead of deadlines and on top of 'stakeholders' thanks to highly performant evaluation and [visualization](https://plotly.com/python/) of <b>chemical process & analytical data</b> supported by the <b>Pandas</b> and <b>Plotly</b> libraries.
  - me keep track of my <b>Day Trading Performance</b>
  - me summarize my <b>Paraglider Flights</b> based on their GPS-tracks, disyplaying them as a <b>Flightbook</b> with some [interactive  maps](https://www.mapbox.com/use-cases/data-visualization/).
  
  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning and getting better day by day at using [Jupyter Widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to make Data Exploration a dynamic and fun experience.

I have a PhD in organic / medicinal chemistry. I work in the field of development and validation of chemical processes for the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients.


## Why GitHub?
It is about time to share some of my experience. As part of the abovementioned projects, I have created a number of Python modules for the dynamic exploration of data in Jupyter Notebooks. Some of these modules may be of general use. 
I would like to make them accessible via my GitHub page. Feel free to use them and let me know in case of any improvements...
