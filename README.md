## About Me

Triggered by the lack of proper data analysis tools at work, I got interested in using <b>Jupyter Lab / Jupyter Notebooks</b> 
to extract relvant insights from data in a number of different contexts. 
<p>I had no absolutely no idea about Python (<em>'the Swiss Army Knive of programming languages'</em>), when I took the first steps in this journey starting in December 2020.<br> 
    &ensp;Despite having no formal background in software development, within a few months, I learned to use Jupyter Lab effectively as a tool to get critical data-related tasks done 
    within a fraction of the time it took me in the past with the 'help' of traditional commercial software.</p></p>

In the meantime, while further exploring the possibilities of the Jupyter Lab ecosystem, I have built a number of samller and larger projects that help 

  - me keep track of my <b>Day Trading Performance</b>
  - me summarize my <b>paraglider flights</b> based on GPS-tracks (.igc files), disyplaying them as a <b>Flightbook</b> with interactive maps and plots
  - my team and me to keep ahead of deadlines and on top of 'stakeholders' thanks to highly performant evaluation of <b>chemical process & analytical data</b> supported by the <b>pandas</b> library.
  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning and getting better day by day at using Jupyter Widgets to make Data Exploration a dynamic and fun experience.

I have a PhD in organic / medicinal chemistry. I work in the field of development and validation of chemical processes for the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients.


## Why GitHub?
For the abovementioned projects, I have created a number of modules for the dynamic exploration of pandas DataFrames in Jupyter Notebooks. Some of these modules may be of general use. 
I would like to make them accessible via my GitHub page. Feel free to use them or to improve them...
